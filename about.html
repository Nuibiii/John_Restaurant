        <h2>Our Filipino Heritage</h2>
        <p class="intro">John's Restaurant is more than just a dining experience - it's a celebration of Filipino culture and culinary tradition.</p>
        
        <div class="story-section">
          <h3>From Humble Beginnings</h3>
          <p>Our story began in 1995 in a small carinderia in Pampanga, known as the Culinary Capital of the Philippines. John Santos, our founder, started with just three dishes: adobo, sinigang, and kare-kare. His secret? Recipes passed down through generations of his family.</p>

          <h3>The Kapampangan Touch</h3>
          <p>Drawing from our Kapampangan roots, we've perfected the art of balancing flavors - the sweetness of coconut milk, the tang of tamarind, and the richness of peanut sauce. Each dish tells a story of our heritage.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="story-section">
          <h3>Modern Filipino Cuisine</h3>
          <p>While we honor traditional recipes, we've also embraced innovation. Our chefs combine time-honored techniques with modern culinary trends, creating dishes that are both authentic and exciting.</p>

          <h3>Our Philosophy</h3>
          <p>We believe in "Lutong Bahay, Puso ng Pinoy" - home-cooked meals with the heart of the Filipino people. Every dish is prepared with the same love and care as in a Filipino home kitchen.</p>
